  This script is written to allow you to use cookie info to access your OnlyFans subscriptions so you can download a creators content to your local machine.
  THE SCRAPER ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAVE ACTIVE SUBCRIPTIONS!!! If you do not have an active sub to the person who you want to scrape the content from, the scraper won't work. You won't get free content with this!!!!
  
  After you download everything from this github, go into the /.settings folder and open the 'config.json' file and fill in the info you need.
  
    - username
    - auth_id
    - sess
    - fp
    
  Once that is filed out, you can start run the 'start_ofd.py' file. Done.
  
# Errors
  There is 1 common error. That error is a "Access Denied" error after inputing valid cookie information. If you know the info is valid and that issue still persists, go into the /.settings folder and delete the config.json file and run the script again.
